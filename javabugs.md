## Description

**The Green Tortois Beetle** is a *very* small leaf beetle found in Asia and more specifically in the Indomalayan region. It is of a _very_ bright and sparkly green color and should be expected to be found on the leaves of crops such as sweet potato or coffe.

Something that differantiates this beetle from many others is its see-through umbrella-like carapace. This is what gives the beetle the likeness of a turtle. This carapace is origianlly part of the beetles lower body but will with time come loose and flare upwards to form a protective barrier above the beetle. This barrier is used to protect the beetle and its larvea from ants and other predatory insects.
